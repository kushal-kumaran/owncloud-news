Introduction
------------

This is the emacs mode for reading feeds from an owncloud instance
running the News app.  The following features are currently supported:

- fetching unread articles

- explicitly marking articles as read

- adding new feeds

Requirements
------------

* emacs 24 or greater is required.  Older versions might work, but
  owncloud-news.el depends on json.el.  If you are using an older
  emacs version, get json.el and arrange so it is loaded before
  owncloud-news.el.

* /usr/bin/curl.  owncloud-news.el uses curl to talk to the owncloud
  News REST API.

* /usr/bin/elinks.  owncloud-news.el uses elinks to render articles as
  text.

Installation
------------

* Add the directory containing owncloud-news.el to your load-path

* Add this to your emacs initialization:

    (require 'owncloud-news)

* Set owncloud-news-path to point to the URL for the News API in your
  owncloud instance.  This will be something like
  https://<hostname>/index.php/apps/news/api/v1-2

Authentication
--------------

owncloud-news.el relies on authentication being configured in
~/.netrc.  You need to have an entry of the form:

  machine <hostname-for-owncloud>
    login <username>
    password <password>

in your ~/.netrc file.

Usage
-----

Run M-x oc-news to fetch all unread articles.  Articles get rendered
into a buffer derived from org-mode.  You can use <TAB> to expand
articles.

If an article has images, you can run M-x oc-news/render (bound to C-c
C-b by default) to render the article content as HTML.

The URL for the article can be opened in a browser by running M-x
oc-news/open-in-browser (bound to C-c C-u by default).  This uses
browse-url to run a browser, so the configuration of that will decide
which browser is run.

To mark articles as read, set region around the articles to be marked,
and run M-x oc-news-done.
